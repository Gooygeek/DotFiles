# A blank line separating the HEADER from the BODY is critical.
#
# The body should include the following parts (where relevent):
# * Description of the change
# * Ticket #
# * Why has the change necessary?
# * How does this change address the issue?
# * What side effects does this change have?
# * Coauthors
#
# Bullet points are okay. They the line should start with '-'.
