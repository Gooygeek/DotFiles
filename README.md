### Dotfiles

A bunch of customised config files and other assorted bits


git-prompt.sh is added to in-case the system has git installd but not the tool that adds git prompt stuff.
This file needs to be saved somwhere that it will get sourced.
Some good places are:

- /etc/profile.d/
- /etc/bash_completion.d/

The location is dependant on the system.
I believe you can also manually add a sourcing to this file in a bashrc file.
